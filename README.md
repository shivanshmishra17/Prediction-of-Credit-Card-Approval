# Prediction-of-Credit-Card-Approval
This project is aimed at building a predictive model to predict whether a credit card application should be approved or rejected. The results include summaries from five different predictive models.

A bank's credit card department is one of the top adopters of data science. A top focus for the bank has always been acquiring new credit card customers. Giving out credit cards without doing proper research or evaluating applicants' creditworthiness is quite risky. The credit card department has been using a data-driven system for credit assessment called Credit Scoring for many years, and the model is known as an application scorecard. A credit card application's cutoff value is determined using the application scorecard, which also aids in estimating the applicant's level of risk. This decision is made based on strategic priority at a given time.

Customers must fill out a form, either physically or online, to apply for a credit card. The application data is used to evaluate the applicant's creditworthiness. The decision is made using the application data in addition to the Credit Bureau Score, such as the FICO Score in the US or the CIBIL Score in India, and other internal information on the applicants. Additionally, the banks are rapidly taking a lot of outside data into account to enhance the caliber of credit judgements.


In this project, we’ll be using Credit Card Approval Dataset from Kaggle. The structure of our project will be as follows —


* Basic introduction of the project
* What’s the business problem associated with it and how is it going to impact the banking sector?
* Basic Exploration of the dataset.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing
* Feature Engineering
* Applying different Machine Learning models that can predict if an individual’s application for a credit card will be accepted or not.
* Performing Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize the performance of models
* Summarizing the results
